/* Representation of a radix tree as implemented in this file, that contains
 * the strings "foo", "foobar" and "footer" after the insertion of each
 * word. When the node represents a key inside the radix tree, we write it
 * between [], otherwise it is written between ().
 *
 * This is the vanilla representation:
 * 
 * 通常来讲, 一个基数树的结构如下所示：
 *
 *              (f) ""
 *                \
 *                (o) "f"
 *                  \
 *                  (o) "fo"
 *                    \
 *                  [t   b] "foo"
 *                  /     \
 *         "foot" (e)     (a) "foob"
 *                /         \
 *      "foote" (r)         (r) "fooba"
 *              /             \
 *    "footer" []             [] "foobar"
 *
 * However, this implementation implements a very common optimization where
 * successive nodes having a single child are "compressed" into the node
 * itself as a string of characters, each representing a next-level child,
 * and only the link to the node representing the last character node is
 * provided inside the representation. So the above representation is turend
 * into:
 * 
 * 然而，当前的代码实现使用了一种非常常见的优化策略，
 * 把只有单个字符的连续几个节点压缩成一个节点，这个节点有一个字符串，不再是只存储单个字符，
 * 因此上述结构可以优化成如下结构：
 *
 *                  ["foo"] ""
 *                     |
 *                  [t   b] "foo"
 *                  /     \
 *        "foot" ("er")    ("ar") "foob"
 *                 /          \
 *       "footer" []          [] "foobar"
 *
 * However this optimization makes the implementation a bit more complex.
 * For instance if a key "first" is added in the above radix tree, a
 * "node splitting" operation is needed, since the "foo" prefix is no longer
 * composed of nodes having a single child one after the other. This is the
 * above tree and the resulting node splitting after this event happens:
 *
 * 然而这种优化使得具体实现更加复杂，例如在上面的 radix tree 中添加一个键"first"，
 * 则必须对节点进行分割操作，，因为"foo"不再是一个单一的节点组成：
 *
 *                    (f) ""
 *                    /
 *                 (i o) "f"
 *                 /   \
 *    "firs"  ("rst")  (o) "fo"
 *              /        \
 *    "first" []       [t   b] "foo"
 *                     /     \
 *           "foot" ("er")    ("ar") "foob"
 *                    /          \
 *          "footer" []          [] "foobar"
 *
 * Similarly after deletion, if a new chain of nodes having a single child
 * is created (the chain must also not include nodes that represent keys),
 * it must be compressed back into a single node.

     * 
     * If node is not compressed we have 'size' bytes, one for each children
     * character, and 'size' raxNode pointers, point to each child node.
     * Note how the character is not stored in the children but in the
     * edge of the parents:
     * 
     * iscompr=0；非压缩模式下，节点中会保存size个指向子节点的指针；

     *
     * 
     * [header iscompr=0][abc][a-ptr][b-ptr][c-ptr](value-ptr?)
     *
     * if node is compressed (iscompr bit is 1) the node has 1 children.
     * In that case the 'size' bytes of the string stored immediately at
     * the start of the data section, represent a sequence of successive
     * nodes linked one after the other, for which only the last one in
     * the sequence is actually represented as a node, and pointed to by
     * the current compressed node.
     * 
     * scompr=1；压缩模式下，只会有一个子节点，只会保存一个指向子节点的指针；
     * size 个字符是压缩字符片段，数据存储布局是：
     *
     * [header iscompr=1][xyz][z-ptr](value-ptr?)
     *
     * Both compressed and not compressed nodes can represent a key
     * with associated data in the radix tree at any level (not just terminal
     * nodes).
     *
     * If the node has an associated key (iskey=1) and is not NULL
     * (isnull=0), then after the raxNode pointers poiting to the
     * children, an additional value pointer is present (as you can see
     * in the representation above as "value-ptr" field).
